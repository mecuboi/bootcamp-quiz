# Multiple Choice Questions Science Trivia

## Description

This application would mainly focus on developing the logic by using Javascript in creating a quiz format and dynamic application for user interaction. Developing an interactive multiple questions website helps widening the reach of education to the wider market and internationally.

In creating this application, I learn how complex the logic of JS can be and how much you can do with it.

## Installation

- First I git cloned the repo into my computer
- Develop the basic format of HTML with different divs
- Then create a basic CSS to visualize a clear separation between the different sections
- Write the JS code to start manipulating the HTML by hiding and unhiding sections
- Create the questions as an array with objects
- Create a logic in adding the questions into the HTML as part of an element
- Create a logic in answering and checking whether the answer is correct or not.
- Set a timer function to end game once timer ends
- Create a logic in saving highscore and bringing the webpage to the highscore page once game ends
