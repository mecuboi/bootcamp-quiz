# Multiple Choice Questions Science Trivia

## Description

This application would mainly focus on developing the logic by using Javascript in creating a quiz format and dynamic application for user interaction. Developing an interactive multiple questions website helps widening the reach of education to the wider market and internationally.

In creating this application, I learn how complex the logic of JS can be and how much you can do with it.

## Installation

- First I git cloned the repo into my computer
- Develop the basic format of HTML with different divs
- Then create a basic CSS to visualize a clear separation between the different sections
- Write the JS code to start manipulating the HTML by hiding and unhiding sections
- Create the questions as an array with objects
- Create a logic in adding the questions into the HTML as part of an element
- Create a logic in answering and checking whether the answer is correct or not.
- Set a timer function to end game once timer ends
- Create a logic in saving highscore and bringing the webpage to the highscore page once game ends

## Usage



Press the start button to start the game

Then select the answer that you think is correct by clicking on it. If you get the wrong answer, then the timer will deduct your time by 15 seconds.

Your score will be the time you have left at the end of the game.

Enter your name so that we have a record of your score

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
